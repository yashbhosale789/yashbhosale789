# Hi there, I'm Yash Bhosale üëã

## About Me
I am a B.Tech graduate from SRM University, currently working in the SAP domain. During my college years, I worked on various exciting projects, including human eye disease detection and vehicle number plate detection. Now, I am focused on working on several domains of SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).
